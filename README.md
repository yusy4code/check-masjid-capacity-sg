Simple app to view the Singapore masjid available slots for daily prayer

- In view of COVID-19 situation, **MUIS** (Masjid Ulama Islam Singapura) comes up with the approach of booking prayer sessions via their website. 

- Each Masjid can take max of 50 people for single prayer. But currently there is no option to view the overall booking availability for all Masjid at once.

- Thus, this simple app will help to view and search the Masjid across Singapore and get the available capacity for each prayer. It will show only for current day and the next day.

The data is being fetched from MUIS website https://ourmosques.commonspaces.sg/
